# Artificial-Intelligence
Artificial intelligence, Machine Learning with python.
My work on introductory on supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector
machines, kernels, neural networks), unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender
systems, deep learning) and best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI).
